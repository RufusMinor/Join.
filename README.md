# Join.
According to my idea, this application will help people unite in clubs of interest, as well as gather cool parties
The application is in the process of being created, registration and access by email using Firebase has already been implemented. The transfer of user data to the Realtime Database is also done. Here I tried to implement the Model View Presenter pattern.

The application has not been completed. The repository will be updated.
